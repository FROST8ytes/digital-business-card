                I am an undergraduate computer science student eager to learn a lot of things regarding computersâ€”from embedded programming to front-end development.
                I am 21 years old, and have been programming since middle school. My first project was an arithmetic calculator written in C++, which at the time,
                was a bad language choice. Now, I primarily focus on learning JavaScript frameworks and the Rust programming language.
